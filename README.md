# Another Look at Inference After Prediction

This repository contains the code and results for the paper *"Another Look at Inference After Prediction"* by Jessica Gronsbell, Yaqi Shi, Jianhui Gao, Zachary R. McCaw, and David Cheng. You can find the preprint here: [arXiv link](url for the arxiv).

## Overview

This paper revisits prediction-based (PB) inference methods, investigating their statistical efficiency and robustness under different situations. We analyze and compare several approaches, including the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method from Angelopoulos et al. (2023a) and the Chen and Chen (2000) estimator, providing both theoretical and numerical evaluations.

The repository includes:
- Implementation of PB inference methods discussed in the paper.
- Simulations and analyses used to generate the results in the manuscript.
- Comparisons with baseline methods, including the code from [Motwani and Witten (2023)](https://github.com/keshav-motwani/PredictionBasedInference).

## Acknowledgments

This repository builds on the code from [Motwani and Witten's PredictionBasedInference repository](https://github.com/keshav-motwani/PredictionBasedInference). We thank Motwani and Witten (2023) for publicly sharing their code, which allowed us to further investigate those methods in this manuscript. The original scripts from Motwani and Witten (2023) are duplicated in this repository.

## Useful Examples

(to be added with deomnstration and explantion for different scripts and results)
