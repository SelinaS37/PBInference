# Another Look at Inference After Prediction

This repository contains the code and results for the paper *"Another Look at Inference After Prediction"* by Jessica Gronsbell,  Jianhui Gao, Yaqi Shi, Zachary R. McCaw, and David Cheng. You can find the preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19908).

## Overview

Our paper investigates the statistical efficiency of prediction-based (PB) inference methods. We analyze and compare several approaches, including the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method from Angelopoulos et al. (2023a) and the Chen and Chen (2000) estimator with theoretical and numerical evaluations.

The repository includes:
- Implementation of PB inference methods discussed in the paper.
- Simulations and analyses used to generate the results in the paper.

## Acknowledgments

This repository builds on the code from [PredictionBasedInference](https://github.com/keshav-motwani/PredictionBasedInference) repository. We thank [Motwani and Witten (2023)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume24/23-0896/23-0896.pdf) for publicly sharing their code, which allowed us to further investigate those methods in this manuscript.
