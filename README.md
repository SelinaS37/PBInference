# Another look at inference after prediction

Code and results for "Another look at inference after prediction" by Jessica Gronsbell, Jianhui Gao, Yaqi Shi, Zachary R. McCaw  and  David Cheng. See preprint here: (url for the arxiv)

The code in this repository is based on the code in https://github.com/keshav-motwani/PredictionBasedInference. We thank Motwani and Witten (2023)  for making their code public, which enabled us to investigate the method further in this manuscript. The original script by Motwani and Witten (2023) is duplicated in this repository for easy comparison.

The only difference from the simulation setup in Motwani and Witten (2023) is that we consider varying sample sizes, as well as consider using a fixed machine learning model (referred to as fixed_train throughout the code and results files). See the associated manuscript for details.
